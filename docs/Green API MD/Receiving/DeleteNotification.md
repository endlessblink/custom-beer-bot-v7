To specify what notification to delete, use receiptId parameter. After receiving and processing an incoming notification, you need to delete the notification from the queue. This requires you to run this method. After calling the method, the notification will be considered received and processed and will be permanently deleted from the queue. Therefore, the next call of ReceiveNotification method will return the next notification from the queue in the order in which notifications come to the queue. Incoming notifications are stored in the queue for 24 hours. Notifications are sent from the queue in FIFO order Request# To delete an incoming notification from the queue, you have to execute a request at: DELETE {{apiUrl}}/waInstance{{idInstance}}/deleteNotification/{{apiTokenInstance}}/{{receiptId}} Note that you have to use a request of DELETE type For apiUrl, idInstance and apiTokenInstance request parameters, refer to Before you start section.
