ReceiveNotification method waits for a notification receipt for 5 sec. The method call ends with an empty response if a timeout is reached. If a notification comes to the queue within 5 seconds, the method call is completed, and the method returns the received notification. After receiving and processing an incoming notification, you need to delete the notification from the queue. This requires you to run DeleteNotification method. After calling DeleteNotification method, the notification will be considered received and processed and will be permanently deleted from the queue. Therefore, the next call of ReceiveNotification method will return the next notification from the queue in the order in which notifications come to the queue. Incoming notifications are stored in the queue for 24 hours. Notifications are sent from the queue in FIFO order Request# To get the next incoming notification from the queue, you have to execute a request at: GET {{apiUrl}}/waInstance{{idInstance}}/receiveNotification/{{apiTokenInstance}}?receiveTimeout={{seconds}} For apiUrl, idInstance and apiTokenInstance request parameters, refer to Before you start section.
