SDK Chatbots Integrations Releases Blog News FAQ Table of contents Request Request parameters Response Response parameters Response body example SendFileByUpload errors Request body example SendFileByUpload# For the SendFileByUpload method, we recommend to use the media.green-api.com host The method is aimed for sending a file uploaded by form (form-data). The message will be added to the send queue, in the response you will receive a link to the downloaded file. The rate at which messages are sent from the queue is managed by Message sending delay parameter. The link is valid for 15 days. The link can be reused using the SendFileByUrl method. Video, audio and image files available for viewing and listening to are sent as in native-mode WhatsApp. Documents are sent in the same way as in native-mode WhatsApp. Outgoing file type and send method is determined by the file extension. Description is only added to images and video. The maximum size of outgoing files is 100 MB. Sending multiple files with one request is not possible. 1 file is sent with only 1 message. The ability to send multiple files at the same time is created only on the side of the WhatsApp application. There are no restrictions on image resolutions. However, when sending images through the API with a resolution exceeding 3000x3000 pixels, thumbnails will not be generated. List of file extensions, that could be successfully sent and received via the API Request# To send a file, you have to execute a request at: POST {{mediaUrl}}/waInstance{{idInstance}}/sendFileByUpload/{{apiTokenInstance}} For mediaUrl, idInstance and apiTokenInstance request parameters, refer to Before you start section.

Time to send a file Sending files occurs in several stages: Receive the file Uploading a file to the WhatsApp server Request to send a file to WhatsApp The time to send a file depends on the file size, the speed of receiving the file and WhatsApp processing the file. Depending on these factors, the time to send a file can vary from 1 to 20 seconds. Quoting messages To quote incoming messages, enable the Receive webhooks on incoming messages and files setting.
