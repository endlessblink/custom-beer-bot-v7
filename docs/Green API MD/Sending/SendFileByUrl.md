SDK Chatbots Integrations Releases Blog News FAQ Table of contents Request Request parameters Request body example Response Response parameters Response body example SendFileByUrl errors Request examples SendFileByUrl# The method is aimed for sending a file uploaded by Url. The message will be added to the send queue. The message will be kept for 24 hours in the queue and will be sent immediately after phone authorization. The rate at which messages are sent from the queue is managed by Message sending delay parameter. To form a link for your file you can use external storages. We recommend using our external file storage via the UploadFile method. Video, audio and image files available for viewing and listening to are sent as in native-mode WhatsApp. Documents are sent in the same way as in native-mode WhatsApp. Outgoing file type and send method is determined by the file extension. Description is only added to images and video. The maximum size of outgoing files is 100 MB. Sending multiple files with one request is not possible. 1 file is sent with only 1 message. The ability to send multiple files at the same time is created only on the side of the WhatsApp application. There are no restrictions on image resolutions. However, when sending images through the API with a resolution exceeding 3000x3000 pixels, thumbnails will not be generated. List of file extensions, that could be successfully sent and received via the API Request# To send a file, you have to execute a request at: POST {{apiUrl}}/waInstance{{idInstance}}/sendFileByUrl/{{apiTokenInstance}} For apiUrl, idInstance and apiTokenInstance request parameters, refer to Before you start section. Request parameters# Parameter Type Mandatory Description chatId string Yes Chat Id urlFile string Yes Link to outgoing file fileName string Yes File name. Must contain the file extension. Requires UTF-8 encoding without BOM. For example: test.jpg caption string No File caption. Caption added to video, images. The maximum field length is 20000 characters. quotedMessageId string No Quoted message Id. If present, the message will be sent quoting the specified chat message. Quoting a message is only possible from the same chat to which it is sent. To send messages from another chat, use the ForwardMessages method Note Link format recommendations Symbols a-z, A-Z, 0-9, - (hyphen), _ (underscore) can be used in the link The link must not contain special characters ~$â¬%#Â£?! and spaces UTF-8 link character encoding without BOM It is required to transfer non-encoded links (the system encodes the link itself) It is required that the link points to a specific file, and not to the html page link examples Required to use fast storage, no limit on the number of file requests Field fileName It is required to specify the fileName field with the correct file extension. File type detection by the system: By the extension specified in the file name, in the fileName field If the fileName field does not contain an extension, then the file type is obtained by Content-Type from the link header If the Content-Type field in the header is missing or contains a non-existent file type, the system will try to determine the file type based on the bytes of the file If the system cannot determine the file type, it will be sent with the default type (binary file) Time to send a file Sending files occurs in several stages: Receive the file Uploading a file to the WhatsApp server Request to send a file to WhatsApp The time to send a file depends on the file size, the speed of receiving the file and WhatsApp processing the file. Depending on these factors, the time to send a file can vary from 1 to 20 seconds. Quoting messages To quote incoming messages, enable the Receive webhooks on incoming messages and files setting. To quote outgoing messages, enable the Receive webhooks on messages sent from phone and Receive webhooks on messages sent from API settings using the SetSettings method or via the console.
